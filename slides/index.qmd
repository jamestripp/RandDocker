# Plan

-   Docker?
-   Why?
-   Next Steps

# Docker {background-color="#2780e3"}

## What?

::: incremental
-   Download the desktop application [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
-   Docker creates or downloads existing **images**
-   Containers are created from images and are isolated compute environments
:::

![](images/Docker_images.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Prebuilt images

::: incremental
-   The R project has an [official r-base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base/)
-   Images from the [Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org/images/):
    -   rocker/r-ver - alternative to r-base
    -   rocker/rstudio - R and RStudio
    -   rocker/tidyverse- R and tidyverse packages
    -   rocker/shiny - Shiny server built in
    -   many others
:::

## Base image

To download and run the official r-base image

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti r-base
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/r-base.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Image downloaded

2.  Container created from image

3.  Terminal enters container
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The command line options are to remove the container on exit (-rm) and to create a command line interface with interactivity (-ti)
:::

## RStudio image

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 rocker/rstudio
```

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/rstudio_container.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Downloads image, creates and terminal enters container

-   The container provides access to RStudio via localhost:8787

-   You now have an isolated RStudio install
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Command line options are remove the container on exit (-rm), create a command line interface (-ti), set environment variables (-e) and set the port (-p) so that connecting via port 8787 will connect to port 8787 in the container.
:::

## Custom images

-   Docker images are created from dockerfiles. A sample dockerfile is below[^1].

[^1]: Sample taken from <https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit>

. . .

``` {.python code-line-numbers="1-6|1-2|3-4|5|6|1-6"}
FROM rocker/verse:3.5.2
LABEL maintainer="o2r"
# CRAN packages skipped because they are in the base image: knitr
RUN ["install2.r", "fortunes"]
WORKDIR /payload/
CMD ["R"]
```

. . .

-   To build the image, go to the folder containing the dockerfile and run.

```{bash}
docker build -t jamestripp/myimage .
```

. . .

-   Finally, to create a container and jump into it.

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti jamestripp/myimage
```

. . .

-   You can publish images to the Docker Hub (or another registry) for others to use (see instructions [here](https://jsta.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/))

## Local files

-   You can also copy files when an image is created

``` {.python code-line-numbers="1-4"}
FROM r-base
COPY . /usr/local/src/myscripts
WORKDIR /usr/local/src/myscripts
CMD ["Rscript", "myscript.R"]
```

. . .

-   Volumes are folders on your local file system which are accessible to containers

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 -v  $(pwd):/home/rstudio/data rocker/rstudio
```

# Why?

## Developers

-   Software developers sometimes wrote code which only ran on their machine
-   That could be a problem

. . .

![](images/works_on_my_machine.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Developers

![](images/docker_born.png){fig-align="center"}

## Developers

-   Developers could build and update images
-   These image are used in production
-   Like containers on a ship

## Researchers

How does this help research?

. . .

-   Aids computational reproducibility [@boettiger2015]

. . .

-   Allows other to run code without having to install lots of dependencies [@eglen2017a]

. . .

-   Language agnostic and used widely [@pittard2020]

. . .

-   Provides the basis for technologies like the research compendium [@marwick2018], binder [@getstar] and Dev Containers [@smith2022]

## Researchers

A few points to consider:

. . .

-   Smaller images with very little software may be preferable as these are easier to maintain [@gruening2019]


. . .

-   Build on a trustworthy base images such as the Rocker images [@boettiger2017]. Do we need to understand how the image is configured? For instance, the rocker/r-ver_4.2.1 dockerfile is [here](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/master/dockerfiles/r-ver_4.2.1.Dockerfile)

. . .

-   If you do not need a full container. Perhaps automagic or renv, which captures the R version and libraries, is enough

# Tools and next steps

## Containers

Singularity Podman

## R tools

Package to manage docker containeres ContainerIt Other packages?

## Going further

Binder CI pipelines using virtual environments
